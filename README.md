## Alternative Dough

Gluten-free baking is a pain. Often times, it requires special blends for different recipes. Cakes need more starch. Breads need protein to replace the gluten. Etc, etc. Alternative Dough is a simple React app calculator that will convert whatever measurement of flour you need into the right blend so your baked goods have the right texture.

###  Cup Converter

This React app also contains a cup converter, because most Americans don't measure by grams. Need 2.5 cups? Use the cup converter to see what that measures out to in grams.
